# Cost vs Revenue Analysis using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between production cost and revenue using a Jupyter notebook.  
The analysis applies exploratory data analysis and linear regression to understand how cost influences revenue using a real-world, uncleaned dataset.

The notebook focuses on:
- Cleaning and exploring cost and revenue data  
- Visualizing relationships between variables  
- Applying linear regression to model revenue trends  
- Interpreting regression results

## Analysis Tools
This notebook uses **Pandas** for data loading and cleaning, **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizing relationships between cost and revenue, and **scikit-learn** for building and applying a linear regression model.
